# pre-built archive for WinAPI
# <WindowsBunny> infinity0: So the libfoo.a in my hundreds of -sys crates are from MinGW-w64
# <WindowsBunny> infinity0: They're import libraries that only matter when targetting pc-windows-gnu
# <WindowsBunny> infinity0: And even then they only matter when the user doesn't have a full MinGW-w64 installation already
# so for now we just omit them because we don't target windows in Debian (yet)
# in the future we will have to figure out how to build them, as follows:
# <infinity0> well, how do we know it's free software if we don't have the build scripts for it?
# <WindowsBunny> infinity0: Well, the .def files are in the winapi repo
# <WindowsBunny> infinity0: and you can uh... run whatever mingw tool to create the import libraries from those .def files
dbghelp-sys-*/*/*.a

# To clean deps before making a new tarball, run
# grep -v '^#' debian/deps-tarball-filter.txt | xargs -I% sh -c 'rm -rf %'
