- transition libgit to 0.25
- write better explanation for the libdbghelp.a stuff
- work around https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43449
- update d/copyright

- see if it is possible to build dynamically linked (e.g. against libgit2)
  rather than embedding these things

Specifically, d/cargohome/config and the override_dh_auto_* rules
